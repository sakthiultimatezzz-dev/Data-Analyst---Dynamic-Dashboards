# Scorecard
           
# While the global achievement stands at 94.7%, the dashboard reveals a critical performance divide: Vietnam leads the portfolio with 123% target achievement, offsetting a 5.3% volume deficit in other emerging markets.

I developed an interactive Strategic Suite that centralizes these fragmented data points. By implementing a "Traffic Light" KPI system and dual-axis trend analysis, I enabled stakeholders to:
# Instantly Identify Gaps: 
Compare actual achievement (ACH) against targets (TGT) at a global, country, or dealer level.

# Track Growth Velocity: 
Use Year-over-Year (YoY) metrics to verify if market interventions are successfully driving sales.

# Optimize Product Mix: 
Analyze "Brand Wise Units" to ensure the most popular models are prioritized in the correct regions.

Executive Sales Overview: Provides a high-level summary of global sales performance, tracking 16,864 total units against a target of 17,805.

15-Country APAC & Global Reach: Analyzes wholesale data across key markets including India, Vietnam, Australia, and Russia to identify regional growth trends.

Dual-Axis Performance Tracking: Utilizes a secondary Y-axis to simultaneously monitor absolute sales volume (Units) and achievement percentages (ACH%).

Advanced DAX Calculations: Features custom DAX measures for Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth, Achievement %, and Target Variance to ensure precise business logic.

Interactive Drill-Down Capabilities: Enables users to filter data dynamically by Year, Month, Country, and specific Dealer for granular insights.

Time Intelligence Analysis: Compares Current Year (CY) vs. Last Year (LY) performance to visualize seasonal peaks and market recovery phases.

Product Segment Focus: Specifically tailored for the 250cc - 500cc motorcycle segment, offering a "Brand Wise" unit distribution via interactive donut and pie charts.

Optimized SQL Backend: Built on a structured schema using SQL Views to pre-aggregate data, reducing Power BI processing load and improving report latency.

Professional UI/UX Design: Implements a high-contrast dark theme with custom tooltips that provide detailed monthly snapshots of growth metrics upon hovering.

Data Anonymization: Demonstrates professional data governance by using simulated corporate data and anonymized model names for privacy-safe portfolio sharing.
